# Pong Game in MonoGame

This is my first game created using MonoGame, a simple recreation of the classic Pong arcade game. This project helped me learn the basics of game development including handling input, collision detection, sound effects, and game states.

## Features

- Single player mode against AI opponent
- Two player local multiplayer mode
- Sound effects for paddle hits and scoring
- Background music
- Score tracking
- Menu system

## Technical Details

The game is built using:
- MonoGame Framework
- C#
- Object-oriented programming principles

Key components include:
- Paddle and Ball classes for game objects
- State management system for menu/gameplay
- Input handling for keyboard controls
- Basic AI for computer opponent
- Collision detection system
- Audio management for sound effects and music

## Controls

- Player 1: W/S keys to move paddle up/down
- Player 2/AI: Up/Down arrow keys to move paddle
- ESC: Return to menu

## What I Learned

Through this project, I gained experience with:
- Game loop architecture (Update/Draw cycle)
- Sprite rendering
- Audio implementation
- Basic game physics
- State management
- Input handling
- Game object management

This was a great introduction to game development fundamentals and the MonoGame framework. While simple, Pong provides an excellent foundation for understanding core gaming concepts.
